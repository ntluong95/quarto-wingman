The risk factors of AMR include the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and antiobiotic overuse due to diagnostic uncertainty, patient demand and physician time constraints. The steps to mitigate AMR include controlling the use of antibiotics to promote animal growth and educating the public on the threat of increasing AMR.},

This may in part be due to the (C1) lack of early clinical recognition of an infection (C1) with which South Africa previously gained little experience during the ongoing global outbreak, potential (C1) pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease (C1), or (C1, E2) delays in care-seeking behavior (C1, E2) due to (C2) limited access to care (C2) or (C2) fear of stigma (C2).

        self.few_shot_examples = """
        Below are some examples how causality can be reported in different forms:
        - Single cause, single effect (Type 1)

        Example 1: (C1) High population density and mobility in urban areas (C1) have facilitated (E1) the rapid spread of the virus (E1)". 

        Example 2: There is (C1) no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N1)v infection currently licensed for use in humans (C1). Seasonal influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from (E1) infection with influenza viruses (E1) that normally circulate in pigs, but they can reduce severity.


        - Single cause, multiple effects (Type 2)

        Example 3: Several countries including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Nigeria (north-east of the country), Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (eastern part of the country) are in the midst of complex (C1) humanitarian crises (C1) with (E1) fragile health systems (E1), (E1) inadequate access to clean water and sanitation (E1) and have (E1) insufficient capacity to respond to the outbreaks (E1)

        - Multiple causes, single effect (Type 3)
        Example 4: Moreover, (C1) a low index of suspicion (C1), (C1) socio-cultural norms (C1), (C1) community resistance (C1), (C1) limited community knowledge regarding anthrax transmission (C1), (C1) high levels of poverty (C1) and (C1) food insecurity (C1), (C1) a shortage of available vaccines and laboratory reagents (C1), (C1) inadequate carcass disposal (C1) and (C1) decontamination practices (C1) significantly contribute to hampering (E1) the containment of the anthrax outbreak (E1).

        Example 5:
        The (E1) risk at the national level (E1) is assessed as 'High' due to the following:
        + In other parts of Timor-Leste (C1) health workers have limited knowledge dog bite and scratch case management (C1) including PEP and RIG administration
        + (C2) Insufficient stock of human rabies vaccines (C2) in the government health facilities.

        - Multiple causes, multiple effects (Type 4) - Chain of causalities
        The text may describe a chain of causality, where one effect becomes then the cause of another effect. To describe the chain, you should number the causes and effects. For example, cause 1 (C1) -> effect 1 (E1), but since effect 1 is also cause of effect 2, you should do cause 1 (C1) -> effect 1 (E1, C2) -> effect 2 (E2). 

        Example 6: (E2) The risk of insufficient control capacities (E2) is considered high in Zambia due to (C1) concurrent public health emergencies in the country (cholera, measles, COVID-19) (C1) that limit the country’s human and (E1, C2) financial capacities to respond to the current anthrax outbreak adequately (E1, C2).

        Example 7: (C1) Surveillance systems specifically targeting endemic transmission of chikungunya or Zika are weak or non-existent (C1) -> (E1, C2) Misdiagnosis between diseases  & Skewed surveillance (E1, C2) -> (E2, C3) Misinform policy decisions (E2, C3) -> (E3)reduced accuracy on the estimation of the true burden of each diseases (E3), poor risk assessments (E3), and non optimal clinical management and resource allocation (E3). 

        Example 8: (C1) Changes in the predominant circulating serotype (C1) -> (E1, C2) increase the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype (E1, C2), -> (E2) which increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths (E2).

        """

        self.negative_cases = """
        Irrelevant causality (negative cases): Some sentences contain causal relationships, but the effect may not be related to the disease transmission or emergence. Avoid classifying those causal relationships.

        Example 1 (no causality): Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.

        Example 2 (no relevant causality): There is some (E1) pressure on the healthcare capacity (E1) due to the (C1) very high number of admissions for dengue (C1); (C1) high vector density (C1); and an (C1) anticipated prolonged monsoon (C1). 

        Example 3 (no relevant causality): (C1) MVD is a highly virulent disease (C1) that can cause (E1) haemorrhagic fever (E1) and is clinically similar to Ebola virus disease.

        """

        self.mechanism_of_causality = """
        When the text describes/list possible mechanisms behind the cause of transmission or emergence, tag them with (M). A mechanism of causality describes the specific interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment that causes the transmission / emergence. They often describe interactions at the physiological level. 

        Example 1: The global outbreak 2022 — 2024 has shown that (C1) sexual contact (C1) enables faster and more efficient (E1) spread of the virus (E1) from one person  to another due to (M1) direct contact of mucous membranes between people (M1), (M1) contact with multiple partners (M1), (M1) a possibly shorter incubation period on average (M1), and (M1) a longer infectious period for immunocompromised individuals (M1).

        """

        self.sign_of_causality = """
        For each cause-effect relationship, indicate whether each cause (C) is positive (C+) or negative (C-) and each effect (E) is positive (E+) or negative (E-). 
        Use the list of positive and negative sign words provided to help determine the sign of each cause and effect. Be mindful of sentences with negations (e.g., “does not improve”), which reverses polarity. 
        Positive sign words: increase, facilitate, support, improve, expand, promote, enable, enhance, accelerate, advance, grow, boost, strengthen, benefit, contribute, progress, initiate, develop, elevate, stimulate, alleviate, optimize, revitalize. 
        Negative sign words: limit, decrease, reduce, hamper, hinder, restrict, suppress, impair, inhibit, undermine, challenge, disrupt, lack, insufficient, incomplete, challenge, deficit, obstacle, barrier, diminish, shortage, scarcity, obstruct, worsen, decline. 

        Example 1: “(C1-) a lack of timely access to diagnostics in many areas (C1-), (C1-) incomplete epidemiological investigations (C1-), (C1-) challenges in contact tracing and extensive but inconclusive animal investigations (C1-) continue to hamper rapid response (E1-)”

        Example 2: Moreover, (C1-) a low index of suspicion (C1-), (C1) socio-cultural norms (C1), (C1) community resistance (C1), (C1-) limited community knowledge regarding anthrax transmission (C1-), (C1+) high levels of poverty (C1+) and (C1) food insecurity (C1), (C1-) a shortage of available vaccines and laboratory reagents (C1-), (C1-) inadequate carcass disposal (C1-) and (C1) decontamination practices (C1) significantly contribute to hampering (E1-) the containment of the anthrax outbreak (E1-).

### Data Source

This dashboard presents an analysis of global child mortality and the association with food security and sustainable development index from 1990 to 2020, focusing on three key metrics:

1. **The Sustainable Development Index**: is an efficiency metric, designed to assess the ecological efficiency of nations in delivering human development. It is calculated as the quotient of two figures: (1) a “development index” based on the Human Development Index, calculated as the geometric mean of the life expectancy index, the education index, and a modified income index; and (2) an “ecological impact index” calculated as the extent to which consumption-based CO2 emissions and material footprint exceed per-capita shares of planetary boundaries.

2. **Child mortality (0-5 year-olds dying per 1000 born)**: Death of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births

3. **Food supply (kilocalories / person & day)**: Calories measures the energy content of the food. The required intake varies, but it is normally in the range of 1500-3000 kilocalories per day. One banana contains approximatly 100 kilocalories.

The data is sourced from Gapminder's global development indicators database, which compiles information from various international organizations including WHO, World Bank, and UN agencies.

The dashboard is designed to **highlight**:
    - Global trends difference in Child mortality
    - Global trends difference in The Sustainable Development Index
    - Global trends difference in The Food supply index
    - The association among indicators

### Key Insights

**Key Insights**

1. **Global Child Mortality (cmi) (1990–2020)**:
   - Marked Decline: Global child mortality rates have dropped significantly
   - In endline (2020): Some African nations still exhibit relatively high cmi, underscoring the need for continued investment in maternal and child health

2. **Global Sustainable Development Index (SDI) (1990–2020)**:
   - Overall Improvement: Many countries have gradually improved their SDI, indicating better human development outcomes achieved with fewer ecological impacts.
   - Regional Variations: Developed regions typically rank higher, while some developing nations show a steady but slower rise, reflecting uneven global progress.

4. **Global Food Security Index (FSI) (1990–2020)**:
   - Increasing Caloric Availability: Most regions show a general increase in FSI, indicating that food supply per capita has improved worldwide.
   - Persistent Gaps: Despite overall progress, certain areas still face undernourishment challenges.
